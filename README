Distiller v1.0

A Rhythmbox plugin to filter music into directories

Author: Chris Oliver <excid3@gmail.com>



INSTALLATION
------------
Extract Distiller where you downloaded it. Run setup.py and the plugin should be installed. Just fire up Rhythmbox and enable the plugin.

By default Distiller copies music to ~/Music. If you would like to modify this, open the ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/Distiller/__init__.py file and modify the value of the variable "destination". Both user path (meaning "~") and variables are expanded for users who are accustomed to using these features.



USAGE
-----
Simply highlight songs and click the toolbar button to have them moved to the directory that is configured in the Distiller/__init__.py file.



TODO
----
- Add a configuration page to set the directory from the GUI instead of editing the file
- Bundle an icon instead of using the Humanity folder-download one
- Build a debian package
