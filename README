Distiller v1.0

A Rhythmbox plugin to filter music into directories

Author: Chris Oliver <excid3@gmail.com>



INSTALLATION
------------
Basic linux knowledge required.

Extract Distiller where you downloaded it.

By default Distiller copies music to ~/Music. If you would like to modify this, open the Distiller/__init__.py file and modify the value of the variable "destination". Both user path (meaning "~") and variables are expanded for users who are accustomed to using these features.

Once you are finished configuring the destination folder copy the Distiller folder to the clipboard.

Open your home directory, show hidden directories, and navigate to ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins

You may have to create the directories if it they do not exist. Once there, paste the Distiller folder inside. 

Restart Rhythmbox and open up the plugins dialog and enable Distiller. You will see an icon appear in your toolbar that is Distiller.

Simply highlight songs and click the toolbar button to have them moved to the directory that is configured in the Distiller/__init__.py file.



TODO
----
- Add a configuration page to set the directory from the GUI instead of editing the file
- Build a debian package
